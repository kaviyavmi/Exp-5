# Exp - 5 STUDENT ENROLLMENT SYSTEM

# AIM:

To study the problem statement, SRS document and draw all the UML diagrams of a Student Enrollment Management System.

# SRS (Procedure):

### Step 1: Problem Identification
Manual student admission and record handling are time-consuming and prone to errors. The system aims to automate student registration, course enrollment, and record management efficiently.

### Step 2: Requirement Analysis
Users: Admin, Staff, and Student.
Main Functions: Student registration, course enrollment, fee payment, record updating, and report generation.
Non-Functional Needs: Security, reliability, and an easy-to-use interface.

### Step 3: System Design
Draw UML diagrams: Use Case, Class, Activity, Sequence, Communication, and Package diagrams.
Design database tables for Students, Courses, Enrollment, and Fees.
